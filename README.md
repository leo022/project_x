# 🛡️ HIPS Alert Analysis System

A sophisticated Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) alert analyzer that uses machine learning and natural language processing to prioritize security alerts based on their significance and patterns.

## 📋 Overview

This system helps security teams combat alert fatigue by intelligently scoring and prioritizing HIPS alerts using:
- Text vectorization and similarity analysis
- Frequency-based pattern detection
- Type-specific risk weighting
- Severity-based prioritization

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Intelligent Alert Scoring**: Combines multiple factors to calculate alert significance
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous analysis of incoming alerts
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies similar alerts and emerging patterns
- **Statistical Analysis**: Provides comprehensive alert statistics and distributions
- **Flexible Deployment**: Supports both batch and real-time analysis modes

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
python 3.8+
numpy
scikit-learn
pandas
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hips-alert-analyzer.git
cd hips-alert-analyzer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Show Scoring System Explanation**:
```bash
python main.py --mode explain
```

2. **Batch Analysis**:
```bash
python main.py --mode batch --count 15
```

3. **Real-time Monitoring**:
```bash
python main.py --mode realtime --interval 3
```

## 🎯 Alert Scoring System

The system uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm that considers multiple factors:

### 1. Type-based Scoring (30%)
- MEMORY_ATTACK: 0.90
- PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION: 0.85
- SYSTEM_TAMPERING: 0.75
- ACCESS_VIOLATION: 0.70
- SUSPICIOUS_EXECUTION: 0.65

### 2. Severity-based Scoring (30%)
- Critical: 1.00
- High: 0.80
- Medium: 0.60
- Low: 0.30

### 3. Similarity Analysis (20%)
- Measures uniqueness compared to previous alerts
- Higher scores for unique alerts
- Reduces scores for similar patterns

### 4. Frequency Analysis (20%)
- Applies logarithmic decay for repeated alerts
- Helps identify emerging patterns vs. noise

## 📊 Priority Levels

- 🔴 **HIGH** (Score > 0.70)
  - Requires immediate attention
  - New or critical threats

- 🟡 **MEDIUM** (Score 0.40 - 0.70)
  - Should be investigated soon
  - Potential threats or recurring critical patterns

- 🟢 **LOW** (Score < 0.40)
  - Routine monitoring
  - Known patterns or low-risk alerts
